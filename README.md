## 🔰 Introduction  
This project serves as a beginner-friendly guide to **Kotlin programming** and a smooth introduction to **Android development using Jetpack Compose**. Kotlin is a modern, concise, and powerful language used for Android development, while Jetpack Compose simplifies UI creation by making it declarative.  

Through this repository, you will:  
- Learn the fundamentals of Kotlin (variables, loops, functions, and classes).  
- Build a basic Android application using Jetpack Compose.  
- Understand Compose components, state management, and UI layouts.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites  
Before diving into this project, you should have:  
- Basic programming knowledge (preferably in any language).  
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed on your machine.  
- Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or higher) installed.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Kotlin**: The main programming language.  
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs.  
- **Android Studio**: IDE for Android development.  

---

## 🚀 Installation and Setup  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carrington-dev/kotlin-programming.git  
   cd kotlin-programming 
   ```

2. **Open Kotlin basics in any code editor**  
   - Navigate to `kotlin-basics/` and try running the `.kt` files individually using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or any Kotlin-friendly editor.

3. **Open Android App in Android Studio**  
   - Navigate to the `android-app/` folder and open it with Android Studio.  
   - Sync the Gradle files (Android Studio will prompt you to do this).  
   - Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

---

## 📖 Usage  

1. **Running Kotlin Basics**:  
   - Open any of the Kotlin files in the `kotlin-basics/` directory.  
   - Compile and run them to see output directly on your console.

2. **Running the Android App**:  
   - Launch the app on your preferred emulator.  
   - The app demonstrates a simple **Compose-based UI** (e.g., a "Hello World" screen, counter app, or form layout).

## 📚 Topics Covered  

### Kotlin Basics:  
- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn about `val` vs `var`, types like `Int`, `String`, and more.  
- **Control Flow**: If-else, when expressions, and loops (for, while).  
- **Functions**: How to declare and use functions, with optional/default parameters.  
- **Classes and Objects**: Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Kotlin.

### Android with Jetpack Compose:  
- **Project Setup and Structure**: Understand Android app structure and setup with Compose.  
- **Composable Functions**: Learn how to create UI elements with `@Composable`.  
- **State Management**: Manage state with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`.  
- **Layouts in Compose**: Use `Column`, `Row`, `Box`, and other layout components.  
- **Navigation**: Implement basic navigation between screens.
